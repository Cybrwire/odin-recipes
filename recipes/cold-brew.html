    <h2>Cold Brew - The best brew no matter the season</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Cold brew is my favorite way to drink coffee. It's chilled over ice, refreshing, and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water.</p>
    <p>To make cold brew, you only need a few things: the coffee, a jar or pitcher, a strainer and a refrigerator.
    Put your ground coffee into the jar, fill the jar with water, and allow it to set for 12-24 hours in the fridge.
    Once the time has passed, simply strain out the grounds and pour yourself a cold glass.
    </p>
