    <h2>Allow me to introduc you to the easiest, most delicious burger recipe you'll ever need: The Smash Burger.</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Smash burgers are exactly what they sound like: a burger patty that is smashed as it cooks.
        </p>
        <p>It's as simple as smashing the patty onto a hot pan. Once you smash it, sprinkle on your seasonings, 
        wait 60 seconds, then flip to the other side for another 30 seconds. The way these burgers are made is that they cook in their own fat, 
        so it is preferable to choose ground beef that is 80/20 or more.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb ground beef</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Form the beef into small 3oz balls.</li>
        <li>Set the pan(preferably cast iron) over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder to a cup in equal amounts.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, place one of your meatballs on the pan, then, using a metal spatula, smash the burger flat to approximately 1/4 of an inch thick.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the spice mixture on the burger covering the top.</li>
        <li>Flip the burger over after 60 seconds. (It will be stuck to the pan somewhat)</li>
        <li>This is where you will add a slice of cheese if you wish. Allow the burger to cook on the other side for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate and continue with the remaining meat.</li>
    </ol>
