    <h2>An omelette is a classic morning comfort food known to people all over the world.</h2>
    <div>
        <p>In all my years eating breakfast, I've had many omelettes but none comes close in terms of flavor than my very own cheese omelette recipe. In my experience, 
        most omelettes include cheese as the filling. It's not a rule set in stone, but most people enjoy a good cheese. So I always pick a cheese(or cheese!) that include
        a bit of depth in the flavor, such as smoked cheese, spiced cheese, cheese with herbs, or cheese with fruit! It's up to you really. If you prefer a standard cheddar,
        who is to tell you that's not good enough! Go ahead and grab your cheese and eggs and meet me in the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>Now that we have selected our cheese, let's start by beating the eggs in a bowl. If you have a small pan, 2 eggs is probably fine, but if it's medium or large, 
        use 3 eggs. Beat those together and then sprinkle in a little bit of salt. Next, melt a pat of butter in your pan and set it on medium-low heat(My stove uses numbers,
        so I heat up my eggs on 4, then reduce to 3 once I pour the eggs in). Coat the pan in butter, then pour the beaten eggs into the pan, and finally reduce the heat just slightly.
        Use a rubber spatula to run along the edge of the omelette as it hardens. As the egg firms up, sprinkle on as much cheese as your heart desires. Let the cheese continue to melt.
        Then as the eggs become more stiff, you will fold the omelette. Using your spatula, fold one edge of the omelette to the center of the pan. Now in once quick motion, fold the part
        you just folded in the same direction. Allow it to rest for another minute. Now remove the pan from the heat and place the omelette onto your plate. Enjoy!
